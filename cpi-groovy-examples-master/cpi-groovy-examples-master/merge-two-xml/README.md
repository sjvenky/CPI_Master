# Merge Two XML Documents

Note: You can also check "Merge Two XML Documents v2" for a shorter & cleaner example.

It is useful to have the extra data from another service in the same document and use it in a later mapping step.

For example, you might need external key-value data and map existing fields based on keys.

In this script, we create `Extension1` element to make the resulting document more clear. You can add multiple extension elements to the same document.

The alternative is to apply this mapping in the same script without adding the extension element.
