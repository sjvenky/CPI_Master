# MPL Custom Header Property

You can add additional metadata to your MPL log with this script. It will show up in `Logs` > `Open Text View`

## Search with more than one identifier
Normally you can only add single identifier to search with `SAP_ApplicationID`. This feature enables storing several identifiers at the same time like IDoc number, PO number, etc. and searching them.

Since 2021 January, this field is included in the standard monitoring fields, so it should be indexed and fine to use.
