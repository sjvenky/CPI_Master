# Groovy Script Examples for SAP Cloud Integration

Groovy scripting is an integral and important feature of SAP Cloud Integration (CPI)

The goals of this repository are:

- Providing templates when you are implementing a new script
- Easily finding Groovy functions related to the CPI topic at hand
- Minimizing search engine time for common tasks
- Providing educational content for beginners

Script examples are provided with context, explanation, and input/output examples.

You can see the examples in a more visual format on [pizug.com/cpi-groovy-examples](https://pizug.com/cpi-groovy-examples)

# How to contribute

You can send any kind of example that you consider to be useful. We can analyze it together, add it to an existing script, or create a new one.

You can [create a new issue](https://github.com/pizug/cpi-groovy-examples/issues/new), send pull requests, send it through [Groovy IDE](https://groovyide.com/cpi) feedback form, or send it directly to [Fatih Pense](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fatihpense/).

If you can create good documentation for scripts, that is great. If you don't have the time, don't worry, we will improve it together over time.
