# MPL Logging Based on Flow log level

    Please see "MPL Payload Log" for a simpler example

This enables controlling log behavior when the flow is already deployed.

It helps if you want to keep logging steps in the flow for development but avoid performance problems in production. You can also enable logging in production for gathering production data or debugging.

You can set your flows in development to Debug and see logs for every message.
